Description: A modern realtime error logging and aggregation platform.
    .
    The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web UI.
    It will handle authenticating clients (such as Raven) and all of
    the logic behind storage and aggregation.
    .
    That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation
    is in Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any
    language, in any application.
